Guidelines
----------

Fasteners
~~~~~~~~~
Use antiseize if aluminum is used in the mate.
Look up max tightening torque for bolt size and materials mating.

LOCTITE 222 THREADLOCKER is applied to all bolts/screws threading into stainless steel or connecting the sealing latches to the main aluminum housing. MARINE GRADE ANTI-SEIZE is applied to all other bolts/screws threading into aluminum prior to fastening. 8-32 bolts used to compress gasket should be tightened to a torque of 9 inch-pounds. All other bolts/screws should be hand-tightened.

.. warning::
   The heads of all bolts/screws must be free of wear and show no indication of stripping (damaged fasteners should be discarded immediately).

Gaskets
~~~~~~~

The rubber is free of cuts and scratches that cross the entire surface. All holes for bolts hold the fastener snuggly. When compressed, the gasket is extruded evenly around all sides.

O-Rings
~~~~~~~

The rubber is free of all nicks, cuts, excessive wear, discoloration, and/or permanent deformation. The o-ring groove is free of water and solid particles. The o-ring has been greased with MOLYKOTE 55 o-ring grease prior to every fitting.

Star Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do it twice. Then, starting at the 12 o'clock position and working clockwise, tighten each bolt.

Anti-Seize
~~~~~~~~~~

Roll the last quarter inch of the bolt in anti-seize making sure to thoroughly coat all threads. Wipe the excess off such that the remaining anti-seize completely fills the space between threads. (Roll threads of coated bolt around threads of uncoated bolt to transfer excess anti-seize and ensure threads are fully coated.)

Chassis
-------

Fasteners
~~~~~~~~~
Use only SS 18-8 #8-32 3/4" bolts to tighten components together with antiseize.

Assembly
~~~~~~~~
Cross braces from main housing have Loctite 271 high strength on bolts.
If you need to unbolt these, heat it up first (be careful of fumes)
Tightening back with Loctite 271

Mounting
~~~~~~~~
Main parts mounted directly to chassis: thrusters, marker dropper, manipulator

Note: Must take apart part of chassis to 100% disassemble manipulator


Thrusters

Assembly
~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
   Ensure all fasteners attaching latches are tight and the sealing gasket appears compressed. DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN IF SECURED!

**Central Core:**

#. Place the DVL Tube Cap gasket on the tube.
#. Place the DVL cap on the DVL Tube Cap gasket.
#. Secure the DVL cap using 6 DVL Tube Cap fasteners.
#. Line up the 'ff' label on DVL with 'ff' label on housing for buoyancy.

.. note::
   For the time being the outermost rear fan bolts must be removed to insert and remove the electronics rocket.

#. Secure the pressure sensor wire out to the upper surface of the housing to prevent it from catch on the electronics rocket.
#. Insert (Land) electronics rocket from the forward side of the tube.

#. PUT THE O-RING ON THE PANEL THEN PUT THE SCREWS IN AND THEN PUT IT ON.

#. Place an I/O Panel gasket into the port mid housing receptacle. (Add link to panel chart.)
#. Place the Port I/O panel against the I/O panel gasket with the giant power SubConn on the forward side.

.. warning::
   Using a flashlight inspect the interior mating face to ensure the gasket is properly seated, repeat with finger.

#. Secure the Port I/O panel using 10 Port I/O Panel bolts by first applying anti-seize then finger-tightening them and then preceding  to do the star stuff. (Add links.)

.. warning::
   Ensure the I/O panel bolts pass through the electronics rocket without being forced, or they'll bend it and warp it.

REPEAT THE PORT PROCEDURE WITH THE STARBOARD SIDE...

#. Place the Starboard I/O Panel gasket into the starboard mid housing receptacle.
#. Place the starboard I/O panel atop the I/O panel gasket.
#. Secure the starboard I/O panel using [some fasteners].

**Backplane:**

* Add screws! Four, 4-40, 3/8", hand-tight, stainless

#. Bolt the backplane to the electronics rocket's four canty-lever rods using backplane screws and washers.
#. Connect all the cables.

**After Extension:**

Attaching the lid:

#. Clean the mating surfaces and gasket, ensuring to remove any excess anti-seize.
#. Place the gasket onto the housing mating surface and then place the lid onto the gasket.
#. For each of the 8 lid bolts, apply anti-seize and then insert the bolt about 3/4 of the way.
#. Tighten all bolts using the star pattern procedure.

Preparing the o-rings:

#. Clean out the o-ring housing grooves with cotton swabs, wash your hands or don gloves.
#. With clean hands squeeze a "pea and a schmear" sized amount of o-ring grease onto your thumb and forefinger.
#. Pull the o-ring through the grease while applying steady pressure to ensure the o-ring is evenly coated. (Perform 3 revolutions of the o-ring to ensure an even coating.)
#. Starting with the o-ring in contact with the aftermost groove, stretch the o-ring around the circumference of the tube and release it into it's slot.

.. warning::
   Check the o-ring to make sure it is not twisted.

#. Repeat for the second o-ring.

Inserting the tube:

#. Align the housing with the vehicle so that the latch tabs are horizontal.
#. Place the leading edge of the housing onto the after frame curved crossbar.
#. While being careful to avoid contact with the backplane, slide the housing forward until, it is within an inch of the central portion.
#. Slide the mating surfaces together, pushing firmly to engage the first o-ring.
#. Hook the latches over the latch tabs, and close them until the locks catch. Pull back to ensure successful locking mechanism engagement.
#. The housing is sealed if and only if both mating surfaces are now in full contact with one-another. (The upper portion will be more "in full contact" than the lower portion.)

**Forward Extension:**

Attaching the lid:

#. Clean the mating surfaces and gasket, being careful to remove excess anti-seize.
#. Place the gasket onto the housing mating surface and then place the lid onto the gasket.
#. For each of the 8 lid bolts, apply anti-seize and then insert the bolt about 3/4 of the way.
#. Tighten all bolts using the star pattern procedure.

Preparing the o-rings:

#. Clean out the o-ring grooves with cotton swabs, wash your hands or don gloves.
#. With clean hands squeeze a "pea and a schmear" sized amount of o-ring grease onto your thumb and forefinger.
#. Pull the o-ring through the grease while applying steady pressure to ensure the o-ring is evenly coated.
#. Starting with the o-ring in contact with a groove stretch the first o-ring around the circumference of the tube and release it into it's slot.

.. warning::
   Check the o-ring to make sure it is not twisted.

#. Repeat for the second o-ring.

Inserting the tube:

#. Align the housing so that the latch tabs are horizontal.
#. Place the leading edge of the housing onto the forward frame curved crossbar.

#. Tilt the housing forward until the lower leading edge is low enough to pass below the downward-facing camera.
#. Push the housing longitudinally for an inch before leveling the housing.

#. While being careful to avoid contact with the camera, slide the housing aft until, it is within an inch of the central portion.
#. Slide the mating surfaces together, pushing firmly to engage the first o-ring.
#. Hook the latches over the latch tabs, and close them until the locks catch. Pull back to ensure successful locking mechanism engagement.
#. The housing is sealed if and only if both mating surfaces are now in full contact with oneanother.
